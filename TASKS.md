# Tasks

* Support further output formats other than PDF and image (in spite of the project's name).
* Think about some kind of abstraction around Scribus's API, at places where it makes sense.
* runner/converter: handle parameters on a per-dcument basis, at least in the Python API
* Improve default parameters, consider using lossless conversion by default
* Improve the readme
* Add tests and sphinx documentation
